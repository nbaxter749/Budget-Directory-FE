application built with Angular 18.2.13, featuring AG Grid for data display, pagination, filtering, and comprehensive testing.\nFeatures\n\nBudget Directory: Browse and manage budgets with detailed information\nAG Grid Integration: Advanced data grid with sorting, filtering, and pagination\nResponsive Design: Bootstrap-based UI with mobile-friendly layout\nTesting: Comprehensive unit tests for WebService functionality\nNavigation: Multi-page application with dedicated Grid view\n\nRequirements\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:\n\nNode.js (v16 or higher recommended)\nnpm (comes with Node.js)\nAngular CLI\n\nTo install Angular CLI globally, run:\nExample :npm install -g @angular/cliDevelopment server\nFirst, install project dependencies:\nExample :npm installTo start a local development server, run:\nExample :ng serveOnce the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nDocumentation\nTo generate and serve the project documentation:\nExample :npm run compodocThis will:\n\nGenerate documentation from your TypeScript files\nServe it on a local server (usually http://localhost:8080)\nWatch for changes and automatically update the documentation\n\nThe documentation includes:\n\nAll components and services\nRoute definitions\nDependencies analysis\nCode coverage information\n\nProject Structure\nKey Components\n\nAppComponent: Main application component\nGridComponent: AG Grid implementation with pagination and filtering\nBudgetComponent: Individual budget details view\nBudgetsComponent: Paginated budget cards view\nTestWSComponent: WebService testing component\nWebService: HTTP service for API communication\n\nAG Grid Features\n\nColumn filtering and floating filters\nPagination with configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50)\nCustom theming with CSS variables\nData binding to budget information\nSavings and income data display\n\nBackend Integration\nThis frontend connects to a Flask backend running on http://localhost:5001. Make sure the backend server is running before testing the application.\nDatabase Setup\nImport Budget Data\nTo import the budget data into MongoDB:\n\nUse the budget data file\nExample :# The budget data is located in: src/assets/budgets.json\nImport into MongoDB\nExample :mongoimport --db budgetDB --collection budgets --file \"src/assets/budgets.json\" --jsonArray\nVerify the import\nExample :mongosh\nuse budgetDB\ndb.budgets.find().pretty()\n\nNote: The budget data file contains complete budget records with reviews and location data for the full application functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    9 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            appConfig   (src/.../app.config.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/app/app.config.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        appConfig\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     ApplicationConfig\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n  providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),\n    provideRouter(routes),\n    provideHttpClient()\n  ]\n}\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    The application configuration that sets up routing,\nHTTP client, and Auth0 authentication for the Budget Directory.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
