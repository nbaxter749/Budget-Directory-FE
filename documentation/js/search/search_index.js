The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nDocumentation\nTo generate and serve the project documentation:\nExample :npm run compodocThis will:\n\nGenerate documentation from your TypeScript files\nServe it on a local server (usually http://localhost:8080)\nWatch for changes and automatically update the documentation\n\nThe documentation includes:\n\nAll components and services\nRoute definitions\nDependencies analysis\nCode coverage information\n\nProject Structure\nKey Components\n\nAppComponent: Main application component\nGridComponent: AG Grid implementation with pagination and filtering\nBudgetComponent: Individual budget details view\nBudgetsComponent: Paginated budget cards view\nTestWSComponent: WebService testing component\nWebService: HTTP service for API communication\n\nAG Grid Features\n\nColumn filtering and floating filters\nPagination with configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50)\nCustom theming with CSS variables\nData binding to budget information\nSavings and income data display\n\nTesting\nThe application includes a comprehensive testing component that validates WebService functionality. To access the testing interface:\n\nNavigate to the test page: Go to http://localhost:4200/test in your browser\nView test results: The page will display results for:\nBudget page fetching\nPagination functionality\nIndividual budget retrieval\nReview fetching\nReview posting\n\n\n\nThe test component automatically runs all tests when the page loads and displays PASS/FAIL results for each test case.\nBackend Integration\nThis frontend connects to a Flask backend running on http://localhost:5001. Make sure the backend server is running before testing the application.\nDatabase Setup\nImport Budget Data\nTo import the budget data into MongoDB:\n\nUse the budget data file\nExample :# The budget data is located in: src/assets/budgets.json\nImport into MongoDB\nExample :mongoimport --db budgetDB --collection budgets --file \"src/assets/budgets.json\" --jsonArray\nVerify the import\nExample :mongosh\nuse budgetDB\ndb.budgets.find().pretty()\n\nNote: The budget data file contains complete budget records with reviews and location data for the full application functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    9 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    2 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            appConfig   (src/.../app.config.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/app/app.config.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        appConfig\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     ApplicationConfig\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n  providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),\n    provideRouter(routes),\n    provideHttpClient()\n  ]\n}\n                    \n                \n\n            \n                \n                    The application configuration that sets up routing,\nHTTP client, and Auth0 authentication for the Budget Directory.\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
